# poise

Poise is a mobile app that enables performers to perform at their peak potential by minimizing their pre-performance stress and anxiety. Someone who is poised for a performance is calm, is ready to execute, and delivers with confidence and grace. Users of the app will reach this state directly before their presentations through guided routines that relax their bodies and focus their minds. These include standard procedures such as "guided breathing" and "performance visualizing", as well as customized actions that users can create for their unique personal experiences.

To try, clone the repo and run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`
