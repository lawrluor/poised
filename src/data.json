Mongo Collection
users = [{
  "user_id": 0,
  "username": "lawrence",
  "name": "Lawrence Luo",
  "password": "password",
}]

Routine
Store just IDs if space is a concern, and cleanness. mongo has limit (16mb?)
{
  "routine_id": 0,
  "user_id": 0,
  "totalLength": 40,
  "overallRating": 5,
  "actions": [0, 1]
}

Write script, query:
For all the Ratings for each routine, average all of them and assign to overallRating (nightly?)

Action
{
  "action_id": 0,
  "length": 10
}

db.find routines where action is 0

Comment
{
  "comment_id": 0,
  "user_id": 0,
  "routine_id": 0,
  "text": "comment text"
}

Lazy Loading: Make two queries, one to query routine by ID on view load. Then query the comments with the routine ID

Ratings
{
    "user_id": 0,
    "routine_id": 0,
    "rating": 5
}
