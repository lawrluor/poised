Sometimes, it can feel like anything that can go wrong will go wrong: your computer running out of battery, an adapter malfunction, your code not compiling at the last second.

Even in a group of friends, it can be difficult to show what might not be your best work. This routine will help you focus on the present and the positives: why you like developing apps and why you're excited to share your progress with your audience. It will also help you clear distracting thoughts that may be making you feel anxious.",
